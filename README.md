# Project-3_INST126
John Lloyde Rayela and Lorenzo Regala


In a professional working environment, almost all the software or digital activities are recorded using log files. 
For this project, we will be using log files that monitors date and time with the activitiy of each user corresponding to different system servers. 
There are a total of 50 users and the log files is generated over a one month period of May 2020. For the project, we are given the task to analyze the log file and generate reports. 
The different data that is recorded in the log file is date, time, activity, server, and user email. The task is to generate reports given the log file. 
The reports must mention the following insights: suspicious activities, irresponsible behavior, system glitches, and domain count.
